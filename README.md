# Built-an-Multi-Agent-System-With-LangGraph

# 🧠 Multi-Agent AI Blog Writer  
### Powered by LangGraph • Ollama Llama 3 • DuckDuckGo Search

This project is a simple but powerful **multi-agent workflow** that:

1. Uses a **Research Agent** to look up real information using DuckDuckGo search  
2. Sends those findings to a **Writer Agent**  
3. Generates a clean, well-written blog post using **Llama 3 (via Ollama)**  
4. Runs all agents as a pipeline using **LangGraph**

Perfect for automation, AI writing assistants, and intelligent research workflows.
